# Layluh

Layluh is a minimalist frontend alternative to YouTube, Twitch, and Vimeo. This project was built with Node.js, Express, and uses EJS for templating.  

## Installation

2. Run `npm install`  
3. Run `node app.js`  

*NOTE: you will need your own Google, Twitch, and Vimeo API keys for the app to work
